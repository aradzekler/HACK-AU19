# HACK-AU19

## POC (Proof of Concept) - feasibility of a new idea
The problem:
what unmet needs/problem this PRODUCT can solve, the task the USER needs to accomplish(learn x) and the desired result.

The solution:
how are we going to solve or help solving the problem, project details, app features, doability (can we manage a team of volunteers? Or a fully-fledged company is required?).

Business Opportunities:
market, who will use it (user persona - backstory of a fake example user and why he would use the app), what is required to further marketability), has this solution was offered before?, who is the competition?.
